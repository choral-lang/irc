Modeling the IRC protocol using Choral.

* Building

It should always be possible to build the project with the most recent version
of Choral. To build the project:

1. Make sure you have the Choral runtime libraries installed
   (=org.choral-lang:choral= and =org.choral-lang:runtime=).

   An easy way to do this is to clone the [[https://github.com/choral-lang/choral][Choral repository]] and install the JARs:

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     mvn install
   #+END_EXAMPLE

2. Make sure you've installed the Choral compiler so that the =choral= binary is
   on your =PATH=. The version of the compiler should match the version of the
   runtime you've installed.

3. Build the project:

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     mvn compile
   #+END_EXAMPLE

4. Run the server and the client program:

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="choral.examples.irc.Server"
     mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="choral.examples.irc.Client"
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   Use the client's textual interface to connect to the server and run some
   commands:

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     /connect localhost 8667
     /nick choralbot
     /user choralbot
   #+END_EXAMPLE
